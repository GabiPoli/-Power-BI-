Dashboard link: 

- I created this dashboard to simulate a trading journal. I used some functions in Python and create random numbers and words to use as Pnl and strategies respectively.
- The tables as in the Table folder.
- The Dashboard has 3 pages showing different data and performance over the years.
- I also include some indexes data, where I scrape it from yahoo finance   

**1- On the first page there are two types of pnl charts and some general information about average trade, number of total trades, biggest gain/loss, etc. On the line chart I included a confidence interval of 90% - 1 month.**

**2- On the second page I explore deeper the numbers based on the strategies, weekday performance and market hour.**

**3- On the third page I included a monthly calendar where the trader can see the picture of how was he/she performance. I added on the left side the Fomo (Fear of missing out) sentiment - a commom metric among traders, as well as the execution reason by  week. The day by day performance and weekly sentiment helps the trader to understand and control yours feelings and adjust it accordingly.**

**4- The last page is where I got the indexes data from yahoo finance. An idea here is to understand your performace based on the index day**
